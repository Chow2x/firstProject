            <p>Primogems are the currency you use in Genshin Impact in order to buy
 three things: Like a lot of other battle passes in other games, you
 can spend in-game currency (in this case Primogems) to level up the
 battle pass if you don't want to bother playing the game and 
finishing challenges.</p>
